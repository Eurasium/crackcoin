Intro
---------------------
crackcoin is a free open source cryptocurrency that implements the first
scientific computing proof-of-work for cryptocurrencies. The unique
proof-of-work design searches for rare prime formations, providing
experimental value for mathematicians to further understand the nature and
distribution related to prime number, a simple yet mysterious construct of
arithmetic that continues to baffle the top minds of mankind.

after completing setup and starting up client.

Intro
---------------------
Bitcoin is a free open source peer-to-peer electronic cash system that is
completely decentralized, without the need for a central server or trusted
parties.  Users hold the crypto keys to their own money and transact directly
with each other, with the help of a P2P network to check for double-spending.


Setup
---------------------
You need the Qt4 run-time libraries to run Bitcoin-Qt. On Debian or Ubuntu:
	`sudo apt-get install libqtgui4`

Unpack the files into a directory and run:

- bin/32/bitcoin-qt (GUI, 32-bit)
- bin/32/bitcoind (headless, 32-bit)
- bin/64/bitcoin-qt (GUI, 64-bit)
- bin/64/bitcoind (headless, 64-bit)
